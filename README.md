Why I want to work in the team:
Because I think the team is the best (Can't remove this Line :) )
Autonomous Vehicle Technology is something which has always fascinated me, And this point of Time I'm getting chance to work amoung one of the biggest brains working together to bring imagination of others into relaity. I want to be the part of this team to count myself amoung these humongous heads.
